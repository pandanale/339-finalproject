                    Rosa Quitadamo, a dynamic and visionary entrepreneur, embarked on a journey to bring the essence of her heritage to the world through the export of extra virgin olive oil.
                    Her father, at the venerable age of 80, still tends to the olive groves with a dedication that transcends time. For Rosa, this venture is more than a business; it's a heartfelt mission to spread knowledge about authentic, good-quality olive oil. Her commitment to fair trade is not just about equitable commerce but about respecting the toil and love that goes into every drop of oil.
